### 👋 `"hello, world!"`
I'm Raúl Wolters, currently a MSc. Student in Cosmology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

### 🤓 research interest
- The Interstellar medium - there's been a bunch of interesting research linking the HI emission field of our Galaxy's ISM to the actual density field.
This connection is so non-trivial due to HISA, velocity caustics and quirks of radio telescopes. However, HI is a super interesting tracer of the - 
as of yet - poorly understood dynamics of the ISM, which play a super important role in understanding our own galaxy in particular and the evolutionary history
of galactic structure in our universe in general.
- Constraining multi-field inflation theories. * insert text *
- I ❤️ Rust. Rust's open development model is explicitly built around the idea of inclusivity, which I think is immensly intelectually gratifying. Anyone,
regardless of their background, can contribute to Rust. This results in people with atypical backgrounds contributing to the project, taking it in a fresh
new direction with loads of ideas that people with a conventional background just wouldn't have thought of. I love wokring on and with the language and
want to expand its goals of including everyone

### Some of my stuff
