### 👋 `"hello, world!"`
I'm Raúl, a PhD student studying the hydrodynamics of heavy ion collisions (and hopefully neutron stars at some point!) at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. I have recently switched to particle physics, having previously worked in Cosmology (multifield inflation) and astrophysics (interstellar medium) for my MSc. research internships at Leiden University.

### 🤓 research interest
- Hydrodynamics and QCD
- Cosmology and Inflation
- Astronomy
- I ❤️ Rust

### Some of my stuff
- 🌌 [inflatox](https://github.com/smups/inflatox) a rust-based python tool to evaluate if (and where!) two-field inflation theories are suitable for slow-roll, rapid-turn inflation.
- 🦀🌌 [rustronomy](https://github.com/smups/rustronomy) a data analysis toolkit for astronomy, written in rust it currently contains:
  - [rustronomy-fits](https://github.com/smups/rustronomy-fits) IO package for NASA's Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)
  - [rustronomy-watershed](https://github.com/smups/rustronomy-watershed) a pure rust implementation of the merging and segmenting watershed algorithms
- 🍇🫐🍒🍎[gruber fruity](https://github.com/smups/gruberfruity)🍊🍋🍐🫒🍧🌸 a minimalist theme pack for vs code

### 🧑🏼‍🔬 Publications
- "Generalised conditions for rapid-turn inflation" (preprint) Raul Wolters, Oksana Iarygina, Ana Achúcarro [arXiv:2405.11628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11628)
