### 👋 `"hello, world!"`
I'm Raúl, a PhD student working on hydrodynamics of QCD at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands together with my supervisor prof. Umut Gürsoy and our collaborators in Utrecht and CERN.

I have previously worked in Cosmology (multifield inflation) and observational astrophysics (interstellar medium) for my MSc. research internships at Leiden University.

### 🤓 research interest
- Computational physics, HPC, computational hydrodynamics
- Phase diagram of QCD
- Spin-hydrodynamics
- Electromagneto-hydrodynamics
- Cosmology and Inflation
- Astronomy

### 💻 Programming
I mostly write low-level, performance sensitive code. That means lots of:
- `C++` (and some `C`) for most stuff
- `zig` 
- `rust` for fun, but also science (`inflatox` is rust-based)

For data-science related stuff (Baysian analysis, plots, ML), `python` is my go-to tool. And of course `Mathematica` to check analytical derivations

### ✍️ Some of my stuff
- 🌌 [inflatox](https://github.com/smups/inflatox) a rust-based python tool to evaluate if (and where!) two-field inflation theories are suitable for slow-roll, rapid-turn inflation.
- 🦀🌌 [rustronomy](https://github.com/smups/rustronomy) a data analysis toolkit for astronomy, written in rust it currently contains:
  - [rustronomy-fits](https://github.com/smups/rustronomy-fits) IO package for NASA's Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)
  - [rustronomy-watershed](https://github.com/smups/rustronomy-watershed) a pure rust implementation of the merging and segmenting watershed algorithms
- 🍇🫐🍒🍎[gruber fruity](https://github.com/smups/gruberfruity)🍊🍋🍐🫒🍧🌸 a minimalist theme pack for vs code
